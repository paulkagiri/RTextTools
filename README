INSTALLATION
============
RTextTools requires R 2.15+, which can be downloaded at http://www.r-project.org/. To build and install RTextTools, run the following commands while in the root folder:

R CMD REMOVE RTextTools
R CMD BUILD RTextTools
R CMD INSTALL RTextTools_X.X.X.tar.gz (where the X's should be replaced with the version number -- e.g. 1.4.0)


SOURCE CODE
============
To modify the R code, go to the RTextTools folder, and modify files within the R directory. After making changes, ensure the package passes R CHECK using the following command:

R CMD CHECK RTextTools
